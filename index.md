## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Organizational Psychology at Michigan State University. My research broadly is concerned with the use of computational approaches to understanding people's individual differences, team dynamics, and how understanding both these things paints a richer picture of how groups work. I am also interested in leveraging technological approaches to psychological research, ranging from working with digital trace data and unobtrusive measures (e.g., audio transcripts, computer-tracked decision-making) to leveraging game environments to measure granular team behaviors (e.g., using Counter Strike to study human-AI teaming). 

## Research Interests

- **Team Dynamics:** team cognition, coordination processes, team composition, expert/interdisciplinary teams, e-sports and virtual team environments, human-AI teaming
- **Personality and Individual Differences:** five-factor model, openness to experience, personality structure, assessment development
- **Computational Social Science:** digital trace data and log analysis, artificial intelligence augmenting team and individual knowledge retrieval, using large language models and neural transformer architectures to examine psychological construct validity
- **Methods:** natural language processing (NLP), social network analysis (SNA), factor analysis, linear and logistic regression, survey design
- **Programming and Other Tools:** R, Python, Grafana (SQL), Google Vertex AI
